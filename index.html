- **Record Breaking**: Under Ferguson, United also won numerous league titles, FA Cups, and European titles, solidifying their status as one of the most successful football clubs in the world.
- **Retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson**: Ferguson retired in 2013 after 27 years at the helm, leaving behind a legacy of unparalleled success, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and 2 UEFA Champions League trophies.
